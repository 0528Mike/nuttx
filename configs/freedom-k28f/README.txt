  This port is for the FRDM-K28F development board that features the MK28FN2M0VMI15 MCU.  The features of the FRDM-K28F board are:

    o Kinetis MK28FN2M0VMI15 MCU (ARM Cortex-M4 at150 MHz, 1 MB SRAM, 2 MB flash,
      HS and FS USB, 169 MAPBGA package).
    o Kinetis K20 MCU (K20DX128VFM5) based OpenSDA circuit.
    o Dual-role high-speed and full-speed USB interface with the micro-B USB
      connector via the high-speed switch.
    o One 256 Mbit (32 MB) on-board QuadSPI memory at 1.8 V.
    o One 128 Mbit (16 MB) on-board mobile SDRAM memory at 3.3 V.
    o Multiple independent voltage domains: VDD_CORE, VDD, VBAT, and VDDIO_E.
    o FlexIO socket which enables you to connect an optional TFT Proto 5"
      CAPACITIVE from MikroElektronika (5" display board with capacitive touch).
    o Easy access to the MCU input/output through Arduino R3-compatible I/O
      connectors to connect external add-on boards.
    o Flexible power supply option—OpenSDA v2.2 USB, Kinetis K28 USB, or an
      external source.
    o FXOS8700CQ—6-axis sensor with accelerometer and magnetometer.
    o RGB LED.
    o Two mechanical push-buttons for user input and one for the reset.
    o Programmable OpenSDA v2.2 debug circuit supporting the DAP-Link interface
      software which provides:

      - Mass-Storage Device (MSD) flash programming interface.
      - CMSIS-DAP debug interface over a driverless USB HID connection providing
        run-control debugging and compatibility with the IDE tools.
      - Virtual serial port interface.
      - Open-source CMSIS-DAP software project.
