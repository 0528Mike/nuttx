 * Name: dlsym
 *
 * Description:
 *   dlsym() allows a process to obtain the address of a symbol defined
 *   within an object made accessible through a dlopen() call. handle is the
 *   value returned from a call to dlopen() (and which has not since been
 *   released via a call to dlclose()), name is the symbol's name as a
 *   character string.
 *
 *   dlsym() will search for the named symbol in all objects loaded
 *   automatically as a result of loading the object referenced by handle
 *   (see dlopen()). Load ordering is used in dlsym() operations upon the
 *   global symbol object. The symbol resolution algorithm used will be
 *   dependency order as described in dlopen().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   handle - The opaque, non-NULL value returned by a previous successful
 *            call to dlopen().
 *   name   - A pointer to the symbol name string.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If handle does not refer to a valid object opened by dlopen(), or if
 *   the named symbol cannot be found within any of the objects associated
 *   with handle, dlsym() will return NULL. More detailed diagnostic
 *   information will be available through dlerror().
