 * Name: syslog_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   One power up, the SYSLOG facility is non-existent or limited to very
 *   low-level output.  This function is called later in the intialization
 *   sequence after full driver support has been initialized.  It installs
 *   the configured SYSLOG drivers and enables full SYSLOGing capability.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
