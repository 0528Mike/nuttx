 * Name: mac802154_req_scan
 *
 * Description:
 *   The MLME-SCAN.request primitive is used to initiate a channel scan over a
 *   given list of channels. A device can use a channel scan to measure the
 *   energy on the channel, search for the coordinator with which it associated,
 *   or search for all coordinators transmitting beacon frames within the POS of
 *   the scanning device. Scan results are returned
 *   via MULTIPLE calls to the struct mac802154_maccb_s->conf_scan callback.
 *   This is a difference with the official 802.15.4 specification, implemented
 *   here to save memory.
