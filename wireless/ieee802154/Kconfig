config WIRELESS_IEEE802154
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Support"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Enables support for the IEEE 802.14.5 Wireless library.

if IEEE802154

config IEEE802154_MAC
	bool "Generic Media Access Control layer for 802.15.4 radios"
	default n
	depends on IEEE802154
	---help---
		Enables a Media Access Controller for any IEEE802.15.4 radio
		device. This in turn can be used by higher layer entities
		such as 6lowpan. It is not required to use 802.15.4 radios,
		but is strongly suggested to ensure exchange of valid frames.

config IEEE802154_DEV
	bool "Debug character driver for ieee802.15.4 radio interfaces"
	default n
	depends on IEEE802154
	---help---
		Enables a device driver to expose ieee802.15.4 radio controls
		to user space as IOCTLs.
