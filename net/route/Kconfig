		Build in support for a routing table.  See include/net/route.h

config ROUTE_IPv4_RAMROUTE
	bool "In-memory"
	---help---
		Select to used a IPv4 routing table RAM.

config ROUTE_IPv4_ROMROUTE
	bool "Read-only"
	---help---
		Select to used a fixed read-only IPv4 routing table in FLASH or ROM.
		In this case, the board-specific logic must provide a routing table
		of the form of a simple array:

			FAR const struct net_route_ipv4_s g_ipv4_routes[];
			const unsigned int g_ipv4_nroutes;

		NOTE:  The read-only variable g_ipv4_nroutes must be set to the
		actual number of valid entries in the array.

config NET_ROUTE_IPv4_FILEROUTE
	bool "File"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Select to used a IPv4 routing table in a file in a mounted file system.

config ROUTE_MAX_IPv4_RAMROUTES
	int "Preallocated IPv4 routing table entries"
	default 4
	depends on ROUTE_IPv4_RAMROUTE
	---help---
		The number of preallocated of the IPv4 routing table entries.  This
		eliminates dynamica memory allocations, but limits the maximum size
		of the in-memory routing table to this number.

		Select to used a fixed read-only IPv6 routing table in FLASH or ROM.
		In this case, the board-specific logic must provide a routing table
		of the form of simply array:

			FAR const struct net_route_ipv6_s g_ipv6_routes[];
			const unsigned int g_ipv6_nroutes;
