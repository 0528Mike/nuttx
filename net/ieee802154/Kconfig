	---help---
		Enable support for raw, IEEE 802.15.4 sockets.

		Raw sockets allow receiving and transmitting IEEE 802.15.3 radio
		frames without a layer2 protocol such as 6LoWPAN in between. Frames
		received are copied into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket tap before they
		enter the network. Frames written into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket will
		bypass the network altogether and will be sent directly to the
		IEEE 802.15.4 MAC network interface driver outgoing frame queue.

	---help---
		For standard IEEE 802.15.4 radios, this should always be 127 bytes.
		However, some IEEE 802.15.4 radios may non-standard frame lengths.

		This setting is currently used only for detection data transfers
		that would exceed the radio frame length.

	default 20
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated frame containers.
		One must be allocated with each incoming frame.
