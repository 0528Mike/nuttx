		Enable support for raw, IEEE 802.15.4 sockets.

		Raw sockets allow receiving and transmitting IEEE 802.15.3 radio
		frames without a layer2 protocol such as 6LoWPAN in between. Frames
		received are copied into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket tap before they
		enter the network. Frames written into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket will
		bypass the network altogether and will be sent directly to the
		IEEE 802.15.4 MAC network interface driver outgoing frame queue.
