 * Name: iob_notifier_setup
 *
 * Description:
 *   Set up to notify the specified PID with the provided signal number.
 *
 *   NOTE: To avoid race conditions, the caller should set the sigprocmask
 *   to block signal delivery.  The signal will be delivered once the
 *   signal is removed from the sigprocmask.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pid   - The PID to be notified.  If a zero value is provided, then the
 *           PID of the calling thread will be used.
 *   signo - The signal number to use with the notification.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   > 0   - The signal notification is in place.  The returned value is a
 *           key that may be used later in a call to
 *           iob_notifier_teardown().
 *   == 0  - There are already free IOBs.  No signal notification will be
 *           provided.
 *   < 0   - An unexpected error occurred and no signal will be sent.  The
 *           returned value is a negated errno value that indicates the
 *           nature of the failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: iob_notifier_teardown
 *
 * Description:
 *   Eliminate an IOB notification previously setup by iob_notifier_setup().
 *   This function should only be called if the notification should be
 *   aborted prior to the notification.  The notification will automatically
 *   be torn down after the signal is sent.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   key - The key value returned from a previous call to
 *         iob_notifier_setup().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.

 * Name: iob_notifier_signal
 *
 * Description:
 *   An IOB has become available.  Signal all threads waiting for an IOB
 *   that an IOB is available.
 *
 *   When an IOB becomes available, *all* of the waiters in this thread will
 *   be signaled.  If there are multiple waiters then only the highest
 *   priority thread will get the IOB.  Lower priority threads will need to
 *   call iob_notifier_setup() once again.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
